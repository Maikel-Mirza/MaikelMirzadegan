### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Maikel Mirzadegan
#### Software Development

Hi Im Maikel from Canada and I do software development. I have been working on software development for 2 years now and since going into Computer Science and building my own projects and my own code, I've really come to enjoy and take pleasure in the work that I do. I want to continue to keep learning and gain more experience in this field. I enjoy learning languages and frameworks like React and React Native, as well as work in WordPress. I also enjoy UI, UX, and working with languages such as c, c++, Javascript, and SQL.
